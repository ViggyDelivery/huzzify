# huzzify
A simple (and very stupid) program that changes the end suffix of every word to -uzz

This was a very simple and very stupid Python program I cooked up late at night. It takes in a user-inputted sentence and changes every single word's suffix to -uzz by indexing the last vowel and changing the word to a substring up to that index plus the suffix "uzz". Might try and use Flask to create a web-based interface or something...
